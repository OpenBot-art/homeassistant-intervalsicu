### Calendar

A calendar entity shows planned workouts, targets, notes, and races from your Intervals.icu calendar. Events appear in the Home Assistant calendar card and can be used in automations.

## Languages / 语言

The integration ships with English, Simplified Chinese (`zh-Hans`) and
Traditional Chinese (`zh-Hant`) translations. Home Assistant picks the language
from **Settings** > **System** > **General**; no configuration is needed.

Entity IDs stay in English regardless of the selected language, so switching
languages never orphans existing entities or their long-term statistics.
Sport names are localized separately (for example `Ride` renders as `骑行`),
because Home Assistant inserts placeholder values verbatim and does not
translate them.

新增翻译后可用以下脚本自检：

```bash
./.venv/Scripts/python.exe tools/check_translations.py    # 各语言 key 结构一致性
./.venv/Scripts/python.exe tools/render_translations.py zh-Hans   # 预览渲染结果
```

## Data Update

Data is polled from the Intervals.icu API every 2 hours. The calendar fetches events on demand when browsing date ranges.
